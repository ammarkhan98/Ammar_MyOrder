    Reflection: The overall experience of coding and creating this coffee app was fun. The only real challenge I faced was when I couldn't get the Picker widget to work. I later found out that you have to just write "Text($0)" instead of "Text(self.$typeSelected)". This way it just gets the value of the option being clicked. Where as when I had "self.$typeSelected" it didn't read the values cause the data given to pick from is from an array. In array's you have to get values by using the index of array. Which I later realize was a foolish mistake I made with implementing this Picker widget. In the future, I'll be more careful on how to read and think thoroughly of how to implement various widgets.
